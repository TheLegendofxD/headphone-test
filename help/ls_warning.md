# LocalStorage Size
This App uses **LocalStorage** to save your chosen *theme*, *language*, *order of modules* and *background image*.
Unfortunately browsers do not agree on what size local storage should be. While on most browsers it is about
5000 characters (5000 KB) some browsers only allow up to about 2500 characters (2500 KB). Therefore I can't be
sure what the limit for you is. You can test it yourself [here](http://dev-test.nemikor.com/web-storage/support-test/).

## What should I do if my LocalStorage is full?
1. Reset your Background Image
2. (Maybe you'll have to do your settings again)
